# CakePHP 4 Dockerized Skeleton App
Sans was here

@todo Right now the directory has to be names app or it won't run. Need to fix it so it will use anything that the user wants.

@todo Create an app.local.php file that can be copied over the apps app_local.php file created during the initial install of Cake.  This should have the env variables so it uses the docker config for database connection information etc.

@todo toolkit has too many specific items in it that need to be generified.  The extra stuff is commented out for now.
